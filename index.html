            <h3>Welcome to our study! Our team has developed a movie recommender system
            called MovieRec that generates recommendations of movies for you to watch.
            The system also generates explanations for why it recommended a paticular movie to you.</h3>

            <h3>In this study, you will be asked to rate different movie recommendation explanations
            generated by the system, as well as the actual movie recommendations produced by the
	    system for you, given a specific scenario.<br><br>The first part of the study will ask you questions about yourself and how
    you approach movies. Our MovieRec system will use the information to generate the movie recommendations
and explanations for you to rate in the later part of the study.</h3><br>
